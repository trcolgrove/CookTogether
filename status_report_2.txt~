Current Progress:

Front End:
Finished all the mockups for the front end, we now have a good idea of how
the finished product will look. 
Did more work in Bootstrap to try and make the mockups reality.
Working on implementing colors and coming up with a uniform color scheme.

Back End:
Working on implementing Facebook API in order to allow users to log in.


Challenges:
Front-End:
Having a little bit of difficulty with positioning and coloring via
HTML/CSS integration with Bootstrap. 


Back-End:
Figuring out how the Facebook API works is a bit challenging. 
Also trying to create the concept of User Profiles with specific
settings has proved a bit challenging.


Goals For Next Week
Finish Front End development on most pages, at least a good "draft" of how
each page will look. Start researching how to turn sketch objects into CSS files. We discovered this week that the program we are using for designing the interface, Sketch, has a easy way to translate objects made from the program into CSS format.

Integrate Facebook API and allow users to be able to Log In and create
a profile.
