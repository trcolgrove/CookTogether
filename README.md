##CookWithFriends- Project Proposal

##Project Title: CookWithFriends

**Problem Statement:** Collaborative cooking is difficult to plan.
**How do you solve the problem?:** We will design a website that allows multiple people to input the
ingredients they have in their houses. Then, the website will generate a list of potential recipe matches with the ingredients available. 

**List of all features that your team will implement**
 1. Have multiple people input ingredients
 2. View full ingredient list with contributor info (e.g. “Frozen Veggies (Aditi)”)
 3. Utilize filters for recipes, e.g. “vegetarian,” “dairy-free,” “low calorie,” “short cook time,” “easy,” etc.
 4. “Cooking groups,” where users are all contributing to the same ingredient list
 5. A method of saying how many ingredients a group and what they still need in order to make the recipe
 6. User accounts/profiles

**Technologies**
*Bootstrap:* We will use Bootstrap for our front-end framework design
*Client-side data persistence:* Store ingredient lists,
*Server-side data persistence:*
 1. We will store data about user’s dietary restrictions and food preferences to more accurately come up with good    suggestions.
 2. We will store information about a users friends, and connections. In a way, a social network for cooking      enthusiasts.
 3. we will allow users to input their own recipes which we will store as part of our database.
 Send emails, SMSes, or push notifications: We will notify users about invitations to cook, or potential recipe  changes.
*Data scraping:* The web-app will scrape cooking and recipe websites for potential recipes using the ingredients available.
What data will your prototype be using and collecting- Aditi
Collecting ingredient list- types of food
Using recipes off of external websites to provide back to client
representations of internal recipes entered by users, stored on-site
Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary - Thomas/Sylvie
We will use a search algorithm to find a list of recipes that fit the group’s criteria.
APIs:
Facebook, as a way of finding friends and connections
google search API: to search the web for potential recipe matches
