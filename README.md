##CookWithFriends- Project Proposal

##Project Title: CookWithFriends

##Problem Statement: Collaborative cooking is difficult to plan.

*How do you solve the problem?*: We will design a website that allows multiple people to input the
ingredients they have in their houses. Then, the website will generate a list of potential recipe matches with the ingredients available. 

Features:
Have multiple people input ingredients
View full ingredient list with contributor info (e.g. “Frozen Veggies (Aditi)”)
Utilize filters for recipes, e.g. “vegetarian,” “dairy-free,” “low calorie,” “short cook time,” “easy,” etc.
“Cooking groups,” where users are all contributing to the same ingredient list
A method of saying how many ingredients a group and what they still need in order to make the recipe
User accounts/profiles
Pick 5
Bootstrap : We will use Bootstrap for our front-end framework design
Client-side data persistence: Store ingredient lists,
Server-side data persistence:
 We will store data about user’s dietary restrictions and food preferences to more accurately come up with good suggestions.
 We will store information about a users friends, and connections. In a way, a social network for cooking enthusiasts.
 we will allow users to input their own recipes which we will store as part of our database.
Send emails, SMSes, or push notifications: We will notify users about invitations to cook, or potential recipe changes.
Data scraping : The web-app will scrape cooking and recipe websites for potential recipes using the ingredients available.
What data will your prototype be using and collecting- Aditi
Collecting ingredient list- types of food
Using recipes off of external websites to provide back to client
representations of internal recipes entered by users, stored on-site
Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary - Thomas/Sylvie
We will use a search algorithm to find a list of recipes that fit the group’s criteria.
APIs:
Facebook, as a way of finding friends and connections
google search API: to search the web for potential recipe matches

Desired pages:
User profile (allergies, friends, submitted recipes, past recipes used)
Features: Ingredient list, Filters, needed ingredients for a recipe
